# facial-emotion-detection
* I have built and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras to recognize facial expressions. 
* The data consists from kaggle(link:https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedmoorsy/facial-expression) of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces.
* The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of six categories (0=Angry, 1=Neutral, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise). 
* I have used Flask to build web-app and deploy it on the Heroku Platform
